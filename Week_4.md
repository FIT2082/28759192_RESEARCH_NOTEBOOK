# Week 4 
This week we didn't quite meet the skeleton site deadline mentioned previously mainly due to our primary focus being on the Research Specification due in 30 minutes...

We did, however, split the tasks up: 

# Tasks 
Cameron: 
	- Mockups
	- Layout
	- Database construction using MySQL
	- Creating the React App 
	- Primary focus is the front end 

LJ (not everything is listed): 
	- Primary Focus is the backend 
	- Setting up the endpoints in the backend 
	- creating the toolbar

We have done market research and found companies like LifeX have developed solutions for controlling smart lights which is similar to this project. Their interface was a good start for us to be able to design our own.
