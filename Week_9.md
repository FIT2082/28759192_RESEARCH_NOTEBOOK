# Week 9 
# Current Stardate: 96245.2

This week we had a meeting with our other supervisor; McCormack, Jon McCormack. He has advised that we start integrating the front and backend A$AP because things will invevitably fall apart (that goes for all 
integrations) and we need some extra time to fix the potential problems. So we've started on that. We've made good progress, the front end has functions that make fetch requests to the backend which handles 
everything. The distance between LJ and myself is a slight issue so we set up a ngrok tunnel to communicate which seems to be working well. It was especially easy writing the methods for the front end because
of LJ's awesome endpoint docs!! Check out the bad boys here: https://github.com/etopiei/plinth_backend/blob/master/docs/docs.md
 
It's been a long a arduous journey getting all of these notebook entries done. At this point, I need to do something to make them more interesting.
