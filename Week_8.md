# Week 8

This week, unfortunately,  we missed our group meeting for the project, however, we've continued on implementing the platform. We started work on configurations in the database (the best way to do it). 
Meanwhile, i've been enhancing the UI, specifically implementing the draggable functionality. There is a slight issue with it though, I need to save the locations of the plinths completely relative and not
absolute. This is an issue especially for cross devices with different resolutions and screen sizes so i've created a fixed sized div that is central on the screen in which the plinth objects are rendered. 
I can do everything relative to the div which is has a relative layout in the page. This should work...
