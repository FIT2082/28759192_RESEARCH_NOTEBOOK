Oh boy i really hope you're a Trekky, otherwise i'll look silly. 

So this is the week just after the midsem break. ELLIOT HAS RETURNED.

I've got to say, Elliot and Jon aren't just supervisors... they're Super-duper-visors. I think we'd go as far to say amazing-visors. 

Anyway, the front end and the backend are 99% linked now. I've taken away all of hardcoded dummy data I was using to develop the front so now everything we have is data from the database. It's looking pretty
clean if i do say so myself. Still some UI bugs that i'm working on, that position thingy from last week is still not fixed. The plinths appear in the div with the correct colour, just not the correct position.

Signing off.
