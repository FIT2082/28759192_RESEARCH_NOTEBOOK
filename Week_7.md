# Week 7
This week we settled on a colour picker design that is both aesthetic and once we implemented it, it was also functional across multiple devices (including mobile devices). 
The colour picker has small coloured segments that the user can choose from, which means that it works well cross devices. 

While LJ has been working on the backend, i've been developing the front end and so this week I finished passing data between the pages. Still some minor bug fixes but it's turning out well.
