This star trek themed notebook entry seems to be spicing things up quite a bit.

We've mainly spent this week working on the poster and the presentation. We forgot about the whole 'printing' thing but we found a place near campus that does it in the same day. 
We have recorded a video for the presentation to show the plinths in action. We can't take the plinths with us on the day so this is the next best thing. 

We also discussed the possibility of us staying on to do more work on the project after exams. We've both really enjoyed working on this platform!

Well that's all folks. Last workbook entry...
It's been real,
