# Week 6

Unfortunately, I haven't been terribly productive this week in terms of this project as I had to prioritise other deadlines for other units. All of my units this semester are very demanding so 
I am finding it somewhat of a challenge to ensure I don't neglect any of my work. 

This week, i've done some more work on the UI specifically passing data through the components and changing colours. I'm still researching the best kind of colour picker to design/use but I
have switched to a design that is far simpler and does appear to work better when using a phone or touch interface.
