# Week 5

This week we began working on the web application. Our primary focus was to get a skeleton up and running. Currently we're still working on it as we ran into some hitches setting the project up. I'm still working on Front end mainly and LJ is working on the back. We currently can communicate with the plinths however, we're using the site stored on the microcomputer as a middleman which isn't ideal but it's great to actually be able to interact and control the devices from this early stage. I will continue to work on the front paying particular focus to the actual color picker and what it's like to use the app on a mobile/table. To do this i can just host the site locally and forward it onto a personal device using Ngrok.
